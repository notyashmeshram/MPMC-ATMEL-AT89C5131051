# Embedded Systems Programming

**Duration:** August 2023 â€“ November 2023  
**Focus:** Implementation of code on 8085 microprocessor and 8051 microcontroller to understand architecture, memory organization, and I/O operations.

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework for Embedded Systems Programming, where I worked on developing code for the 8085 microprocessor and the 8051 microcontroller. The main objective was to understand how to program these architectures at a low level, focusing on assembly and embedded C programming. 

The project is divided into two main sections:
- **Labs 1-4:** Code for the 8085 microprocessor, implemented in the 8085 IDE environment.
- **Labs 5-10:** Code for the 8051 microcontroller (AT89C5131), programmed using MCU8051IDE and Atmel Flip.

## Tools & Technologies
- **8085Compiler**: Used to compile and execute 8085 assembly code.
- **MCU8051IDE**: An integrated development environment for simulating and developing code for the 8051 microcontroller.
- **Atmel Flip**: A tool for flashing firmware onto Atmel microcontrollers.
- **Languages**: C, x86 Assembly

## Lab Details

### Labs 1-4: 8085 Microprocessor
These labs cover the basics of programming the 8085 microprocessor, focusing on:
- Understanding the 8085 architecture
- Handling basic I/O operations
- Memory interfacing
- Implementing basic algorithms using assembly language

### Labs 5-10: 8051 Microcontroller (AT89C5131)
These labs transition into the 8051 microcontroller, focusing on:
- Programming in embedded C and assembly for the 8051
- Interfacing peripherals like timers, counters, and serial communication
- Flashing the microcontroller with the firmware using Atmel Flip

## How to Use

1. **8085 Microprocessor Labs (1-4)**:
   - Open the files in an 8085 compiler or IDE such as the [8085 Simulator IDE](https://github.com/8085simulator/8085simulator/raw/master/dist/8085Compiler.jar).
   - Compile and run the assembly files to observe the behavior of the code.

2. **8051 Microcontroller Labs (5-10)**:
   - Open the `.c` files in **MCU8051IDE**.
   - Compile the code and use **Atmel Flip** to flash the generated hex file onto an AT89C5131 microcontroller.
